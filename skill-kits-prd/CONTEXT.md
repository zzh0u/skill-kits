## Example dialogue · 示例对话

> **Dev:** "When a user uninstalls a Skill in the GUI, do we delete the original folder?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Uninstall removes the Managed Skill from Global Inventory, but never deletes the Source Path."

> **Dev:** "Does Uninstall remove copies already deployed into projects?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Project copies are removed only through Remove From Project."

> **Dev:** "Does Remove From Project delete every skill in the project Agent directory?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It deletes only the selected Project Skill Deployment directory."

> **Dev:** "Can a user remove a project copy that has local changes?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes, but only through Forced Project Removal with GUI confirmation or CLI `--force`."

> **Dev:** "How do we automatically synchronize skills that already exist in Codex before Skill-kits is installed?"
> **Domain expert:** "Run Adopt first. Adopt imports existing Agent skills into Global Inventory; project usage then goes through Deploy."

> **Dev:** "Can Adopt import project-local skills too?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Global Agent Adopt imports from real global Agent directories; Project Adopt imports from one Project Skill Directory."

> **Dev:** "After Project Adopt, does Skill-kits know that the existing project copy belongs to the new Managed Skill?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Project Adopt records a Deployment Baseline linking the project copy to its Managed Skill without moving or modifying files."

> **Dev:** "If Codex and Claude both have `frontend-design`, do we merge them?"
> **Domain expert:** "Only when their content hashes match; otherwise Adopt creates an Adoption Conflict for the user to resolve."

> **Dev:** "How can a user resolve an Adoption Conflict in v0.1?"
> **Domain expert:** "Import it as a new Managed Skill or skip it; v0.1 does not merge or replace existing Skills."

> **Dev:** "How does project-level enablement work?"
> **Domain expert:** "Skill-kits physically deploys a Managed Skill into the Agent's Project Skill Directory, scans it as Project Scope, and toggles `SKILL.md` versus `SKILL.md.disabled`."

> **Dev:** "Can Skill-kits enable project skills for an Agent that only supports global skills?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 project-level support requires a Project-supported Agent with a declared Project Skill Directory."

> **Dev:** "Which Agents are built in for v0.1?"
> **Domain expert:** "Codex uses `.agents/skills`, Claude Code uses `.claude/skills`, and Gemini CLI uses `.gemini/skills`; other Agents are Custom Agents."

> **Dev:** "Does v0.1 support YAML CLI output?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 supports table for humans and JSON for scripts."

> **Dev:** "What is the v0.1 GUI navigation order?"
> **Domain expert:** "Dashboard, Skills, Agents, then Projects."

> **Dev:** "When disabling a project Skill, do we move or delete the whole directory?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Disable only renames `SKILL.md` to `SKILL.md.disabled`; other files stay in place."

> **Dev:** "Does project deployment use symlinks by default?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 copies Managed Skills into Project Skill Directories by default."

> **Dev:** "Is a newly deployed project Skill enabled immediately?"
> **Domain expert:** "Yes. Deploy creates an enabled Project Skill Deployment by default."

> **Dev:** "What happens if Deploy finds an existing same-name project directory?"
> **Domain expert:** "Deploy stops with Deploy Conflict unless that directory is already recorded as the selected Managed Skill deployment."

> **Dev:** "When a Managed Skill changes, do project copies update automatically?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. They become Outdated Deployments until the user explicitly redeploys them."

> **Dev:** "If a project copy was modified and the Managed Skill also changed, who wins?"
> **Domain expert:** "Nobody wins automatically. The user must keep the project copy, overwrite from managed, or promote the project copy to managed."

> **Dev:** "Does Promote To Managed replace the original Managed Skill?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 creates a Managed Skill Fork and keeps the original Managed Skill unchanged."

> **Dev:** "Should the GUI start in project view?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. The GUI starts with Dashboard and leads with Agent Space instance counts plus Managed Inventory summary."

> **Dev:** "Does v0.1 need SQLite?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Registry is plain TOML files under `~/.skill-kits/registry/`."

> **Dev:** "How do GUI and CLI avoid corrupting TOML registry files?"
> **Domain expert:** "All registry writes take Registry Lock and write through temp file plus atomic rename."

> **Dev:** "Does scan block risky skills in v0.1?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Security Scan produces a Risk Report by default; Policy Enforcement is a future optional mode."

> **Dev:** "Does doctor inspect Agent auth, API keys, or network?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Doctor Check stays lightweight and only checks Skill-kits-owned or recorded state."

> **Dev:** "Can doctor --fix repair everything automatically?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Doctor Fix only performs low-risk cleanup and never deletes, overwrites, or promotes project copies."

> **Dev:** "Does the GUI scan every recent project at startup?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Startup reads summaries only; Project Onboarding Scan performs one full scan when a project is first opened."

> **Dev:** "Does Project Onboarding Scan automatically import discovered project Skills?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. It shows discovered Skills and waits for Adopt All or per-Skill Project Adopt."

> **Dev:** "Should Adopt All stop at the first conflict?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Adopt All imports non-conflicting Skills and reports conflicts separately as Partial Adopt Success."

> **Dev:** "Does Skill-kits automatically edit `.gitignore`?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 only shows Git Ignore Guidance."

> **Dev:** "How does the GUI find projects?"
> **Domain expert:** "The user opens a project explicitly; Skill-kits adds it to Recent Projects and does not scan the whole machine."

> **Dev:** "How does the CLI know which project to manage?"
> **Domain expert:** "Project commands use the current directory by default and accept `--project <path>` for explicit scope."

> **Dev:** "Should project copy actions be called sync?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Project actions are Deploy and Redeploy because they copy Managed Skills into project directories."

> **Dev:** "Does v0.1 download Skills from GitHub or a marketplace?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. v0.1 only supports Local Install, Global Agent Adopt, and Project Adopt."

> **Dev:** "How is the CLI divided?"
> **Domain expert:** "Global Commands manage Global Inventory; Project Commands manage project deployments."

> **Dev:** "What is the difference between global status and project status?"
> **Domain expert:** "Global Status summarizes inventory and system health; Project Status summarizes deployments inside one Project Scope."

> **Dev:** "What platform does v0.1 ship first?"
> **Domain expert:** "macOS single binary first; Windows and Linux follow after the core flow is stable."

> **Dev:** "Can we use the skill folder name as the registry key?"
> **Domain expert:** "No. Registry and markers use Skill ID; Skill Name is only human-facing and can change."

> **Dev:** "Where does the displayed skill name come from in v0.1?"
> **Domain expert:** "Use the imported directory name as Skill Name; parse SKILL.md only as optional metadata."
