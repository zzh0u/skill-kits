# Workbench Grid Polish Design

Status: frozen for implementation.

## Purpose

This polish tranche improves the existing egui desktop interface without changing Skill-kits behavior. It focuses on the left sidebar, Dashboard alignment, and Skill view hover/read-only states.

The goal is a stricter traditional workbench: more generous navigation hit areas, cleaner grid alignment, and more reliable hover feedback.

## Non-Goals

- Do not rename the Skill view.
- Do not change native Skill enable/disable behavior.
- Do not introduce plugin management UI in this tranche.
- Do not replace egui with a web frontend.
- Do not introduce new runtime dependencies.
- Do not change CLI behavior.

## Design Register

Product UI. Design serves repeated operational use. The app should stay dense, monochrome, and quiet.

## Current Problems

### Sidebar

The sidebar is too compressed. Navigation items are readable, but they do not yet feel like first-class app sections. The current presentation relies on default selectable labels, which makes icon, text, active fill, and hover spacing less controlled.

### Dashboard

Dashboard sections use separators, but the divider and content alignment can feel uneven. Horizontal lines should align to the same content grid so sections read as one system.

Hover feedback also feels too soft. Rows should respond immediately and locally.

### Skill View

Read-only rows or badges can look like they are already hovered. Hover feedback can also make multiple regions feel active at once, especially when the row and badge backgrounds both shift too strongly.

The desired behavior is:

- read-only default is quiet
- hover uses one consistent row color
- selected uses a stronger but still monochrome color
- status badges stay readable without competing with row hover

## Proposed Design

### 1. Sidebar As Grid Tabs

Increase sidebar width from `204.0` to approximately `244.0`.

Render primary navigation with a custom row instead of plain `selectable_label`:

- row height: `36.0`
- icon column: `24.0`
- label starts on a fixed x position
- horizontal inset: `10.0`
- row radius: `5.0`
- active fill: `surface_3`
- hover fill: `surface_2`
- active text: `ink`
- inactive text: `ink_muted`
- icon color follows label color

Navigation order remains:

1. Dashboard
2. Skill
3. Agent
4. Project

Scope and Recent Projects remain below primary navigation, but should use the same left inset grid. Recent project rows may stay quieter than primary tabs.

### 2. Dashboard Divider Alignment

Create a small section rendering helper for Dashboard rows and groups:

- common left inset for section headings and rows
- dividers span from the same x origin to the same right edge
- section title, divider, and content rows share a vertical rhythm
- avoid mixed separators that start at different x positions

Dashboard should continue to avoid large metric cards. Use compact summary rows and section groups.

### 3. Unified Main Content Grid

All primary content in the main pane should derive from one content grid helper.

Rules:

- use `MAIN_CONTENT_INSET = 12.0` as the single horizontal inset
- page title, divider, Actions strip, filter strip, Dashboard section heading, Dashboard rows, table header, table rows, and row hover fills align to the same left edge
- divider and row hover fills use the same right edge
- table header first column and table row first cell share the same x origin
- Actions and filters sit inside the main content inset, not as free-floating toolbar lines
- empty-state copy starts on the same content left edge

This is a visual/layout polish only. It must not change CLI behavior, Skill enable/disable behavior, plugin enable/disable behavior, or row selection semantics.

### 4. More Immediate Hover Feedback

Use explicit row painting where the current default widget hover is too soft or too broad.

Rules:

- hover fill: `surface_2`
- selected fill: `surface_3`
- focus outline: `focus`
- no secondary hover fill inside badges that makes both row and badge compete
- disabled/read-only text uses `ink_subtle` or `ink_tertiary`, not a hover-like background

### 5. Skill View Read-Only Treatment

Adjust status badge and row interaction so `Read-only` starts visually quiet:

- default badge background: `surface_1` or transparent-like dark surface
- badge border or text carries the read-only meaning
- read-only icon can use the lock icon already available through Font Awesome
- hover should not make the read-only badge look separately selected

When hovering a Skill row:

- the whole row gets `surface_2`
- status badges keep their compact badge shape
- selected row gets `surface_3`
- only the selected row should look persistent

### 6. Workbench Component Motion

Use egui `Ui` allocation and `Context` animation APIs to make controls feel native to the workbench instead of default egui widgets.

Rules:

- sidebar primary tabs and scope rows use the same hover alpha animation as table rows
- action buttons use one compact workbench button component instead of mixed default buttons
- button height is stable, icon and label are aligned, and destructive actions use text/stroke emphasis instead of a loud fill
- disabled buttons keep their footprint and use muted text
- filter controls use fixed-width compact ComboBox widgets with stable labels and spacing
- plugin package rows show a right-side disclosure affordance so the secondary Skill view reads as a drill-in interaction
- secondary plugin view keeps the Back action visually compact and icon-led

This polish should keep motion purposeful: hover and focus feedback only. No page-load animation, decorative transitions, or layout animation.

## Implementation Notes

Likely files:

- `src/gui/mod.rs`
- `src/gui/dashboard.rs`
- `src/gui/skills.rs`
- `src/gui/icons.rs` only if icon helper names need minor extension
- `tests/gui_skeleton.rs` for pure mapping/layout helper tests

Suggested extraction:

- `render_sidebar_nav_item(...)`
- `render_sidebar_scope_item(...)`
- `render_dashboard_section(...)`
- `workbench_content_grid(...)`
- `workbench_button_metrics(...)`
- `workbench_filter_width(...)`
- `plugin_row_disclosure(...)`
- `row_fill(selected, hovered, colors)`
- `status_badge_surface(value, row_hovered, selected, colors)`

Keep helpers small and local to GUI modules unless reuse becomes obvious.

## Testing

Add or update tests for pure helper behavior where possible:

- sidebar nav labels preserve `Dashboard`, `Skill`, `Agent`, `Project`
- hover/selected fill precedence is selected over hovered
- `Read-only` status maps to read-only icon and quiet status category
- main content helper returns one shared inset and right edge for heading, divider, table header, table rows, and Dashboard rows
- workbench button helper returns stable height/radius/padding metrics
- Skill filters return stable widths by filter kind
- plugin package rows expose a disclosure affordance while plugin Skill detail rows do not
- Dashboard section helper preserves stable section ordering if represented in renderable data

Manual verification:

- launch `rtk cargo run -- --gui`
- inspect sidebar width and tab alignment
- hover Dashboard rows and Skill rows
- confirm Read-only default is not confused with hover
- confirm selected Skill row remains visually distinct from hover

## Acceptance Criteria

- Sidebar primary navigation feels like stable tab navigation with strict icon and label alignment.
- Dashboard dividers and section content align to one visible grid.
- Main-pane title, divider, actions, filters, table header, table rows, and hover fills use one shared content inset.
- Dashboard hover feedback is immediate and local to the hovered item.
- Skill row hover no longer makes unrelated left/right areas look active.
- Read-only default state is quieter than hover.
- Hover color is consistent across Skill rows.
- Sidebar hover fades in consistently with main workbench rows.
- Action controls use one compact button vocabulary across Skills, Projects, Agents, and Plugins.
- Skill filters keep fixed widths and aligned labels.
- Plugin package rows include a visible disclosure cue for the secondary Skill list.
- No business logic or CLI behavior changes.
- `cargo fmt --check` and `cargo test` pass.
